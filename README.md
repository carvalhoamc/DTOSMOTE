# DTO-SMOTE
DELAUNAY THETRAEDRAL OVERSAMPLING SMOTE

Oversampling creates synthetic or duplicate minority class sam-
ples to match the same number of samples from the majority class.
As a result, the training data set becomes balanced before the training
phase. DTO-SMOTE constructs a mesh of simplices
for creating synthetic examples.
